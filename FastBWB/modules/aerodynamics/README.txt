The aerodynamics module contains 4 groups that call multiple components.
The codes are commented so it is easy to understand which files are groups,
which files are components and which groups call which components. The
groups are the files on the same folder as this txt file. The components
are all within aero_components.

On a first stage of the project, portuguese words were used to name groups
and components so as to track which code errors belonged to files of mine.
As the project evolved, it became work-wise expensive to change names and
risk the integrity of the software, hence they were kept that way. Here's
a list of used portuguese words and their translation:

Calculo - Computation
Aerodinamica - Aerodynamics
Asa - Wing
Cauda - Tail
Induzido - Induced
Fuselagem - Fuselage
Equilibrio - Trim/Equilibrium

Furthermore, a tracking of the inputs/outputs exchange between components
and groups was mapped with an excel sheet. The file is on the same folder 
as this document. It is heavily recommended in order to understand which
inputs/outputs are used in which components.
