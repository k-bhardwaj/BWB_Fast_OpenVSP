For starters, run FAST-OAD-BWB Tutorial.ipynb for a simple run of the
software. On a more advanced possibility, Simulations_BWB.ipynb and
Post_processingBWB.ipynb may be run for sensitivity analysis.

The code is composed by:
1. Jupyter Notebooks to run the program.
2. Input files in the data folder.
3. Configuration files in the workspace folder.
4. Python files in the modules folder.

The outputs of the program may always be checked on the workspace
after running.

Disclaimer:
Project benefited greatly from the work of A. Sgueglia on
his PhD. thesis (2019), as well as from Onera and ISAE-Supaero for the
developement of FAST-OAD. The structure of the algorithm is taken
from FAST-OAD, while the contents from most components are taken
from Sgueglia's research and from Sgueglia's earlier version of
this tool.
