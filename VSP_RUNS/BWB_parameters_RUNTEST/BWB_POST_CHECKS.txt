LONGITUDINAL STABILITY	Passed	# SECTION HEADING

Cz_alpha	Passed	Positive force gradient on increasing alpha
Cz_q	Passed	Pitch up rotation increases alpha and thus, upward force.
Cm_alpha	Passed	Positive damping in pitch due to alpha.
Cm_q	Passed	Positive pitch damping.


LATERAL STABILITY	Passed	# SECTION HEADING

Cy_beta	Passed	Correct sideforce produced in sideslip.
Cy_p	Failed	Excessive sideforce due to roll rate. Potential Reason: Wing parameters like sweep and dihedral might be sub-optimal. Potential Fix: Adjust wing geometry.
Cy_r	Failed	Negative yaw damping. Potential Reason: Inadequate vertical tail design. Potential Fix: Optimize vertical tail size or shape.
Cl_beta	Failed	Roll instability in sideslip. Potential Reason: Aerodynamic design does not promote roll stability. Potential Fix: Adjust wing geometry effecting dihedral like sweep and dihedral angle.
Cl_p	Passed	Positive roll damping.
Cl_r	Passed	Yaw rate induces roll in the correct direction.
Cn_beta	Failed	Negative or no directional stability. Potential Reason: CG could be behind the vertical tail. Potential Fix: Check CG location and vertical tail placement.
Cn_p	Failed	Lack of adverse yaw damping. Potential Reason: Wing aerodynamics not contributing to yaw damping. Potential Fix: Review and adjust wing design for better yaw damping.
Cn_r	Failed	Negative or no yaw damping. Potential Reason: CG could be behind the vertical tail. Potential Fix: Check CG location and vertical tail placement.


DYNAMIC STABILITY	Passed	 # SECTION HEADING - If time period of any mode is -1, it means mode is overdamped with zeta >= 1 or < 0.

Short period mode	Failed	Short period mode is divergent, zeta_sp=-1.0638853702525075.
Phugoid mode	Passed	Phugoid mode is convergent with time period: 76.08491526386518 s and damping factor 0.037613140104238524
Dutch Roll mode	Failed	Dutch Roll mode is divergent, zeta_dr-0.017309829071221715.
Roll mode	Passed	Roll mode is convergent with characteristic time: 0.46619140985815166 s
Pure yaw mode	Passed	Pure yaw mode is convergent with characteristic time: -1 s
Spiral mode	Failed	Spiral mode is divergent.


CONTROL DERIVATIVES	Passed	# SECTION HEADING

Cz_dm	Passed	Elevator effective in producing correct vertical force.
Cm_dm	Passed	Elevator deflection produces correct pitch response.
Cy_dl	Passed	Ailerons produce minimal side force.
Cy_dn	Passed	Rudder deflection produces correct side force.
Cl_dl	Failed	Aileron deflection produces opposite roll response. Potential Reason: Location or size of ailerons. Potential Fix: Check aileron design.
Cl_dn	Failed	Rudder ineffective in inducing roll moment. Potential Reason: Rudder and aileron interplay is not optimized. Potential Fix: Review rudder-aileron effectiveness and adjust accordingly.
Cn_dl	Passed	Ailerons produce minimal yawing moment.
Cn_dn	Passed	Rudder deflection produces correct yaw response.
